5. we're going to meet in the programming club on tuesdays.  i think alex was responsible for this.
6. nick y., and liz searched high and low for windriver.  thanks guys
7. mike added instructions for getting netbeans up and running
8. mike got the driver station and firmware flashing stuff installed on his box
goals
1. get a git client installed on your computer by following the instructions here: http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect
2. get the driver station and the firmware flashing stuff installed on your box.  http://firstforge.wpi.edu/sf/frs/do/viewSummary/projects.wpilib/frs  do this at home.  right now.  don't wait till you're at school and you have to use up all of my phone's bandwidth and kill everyone else's browsing.
3. install netbeans on your own computer.  make sure to get the FRC additions.  again, do it right now.  https://github.com/erhs-53-hackers/housekeeping/blob/master/setup-new-dev-box.rkt  go to the "java" section, starting on line 13.
4. nick post a request to chief delphi for someone to post their compiled robotpy interpreter.  the file is FRC_UserProgram.out
5. get documentation worked out.  we have a pretty unique opportunity to document the process of setting up a development environment.  no one else is crazy enough to give 4 programming languages a go at once.  let's make some instructional videos for the team's youtube channel!  let's make a youtube channel for the team if there isn't one already!
